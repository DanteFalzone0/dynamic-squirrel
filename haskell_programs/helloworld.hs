-- This is Dante's first Haskell program. Compile with:
--  ghc helloworld.hs

-- I'm a bit tired of object-oriented programming.

-- I'm sick of such crufty types as "abstract virtual
-- private class constructor". (Looking at you, Java.)

-- So I'm going to start coding in a whole new paradigm.
-- Functional programming FTW!
main = putStrLn "Hello, world!"
