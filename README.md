This is Dante Falzone's first Github repository.

Dante Falzone has a decent amount of experience with Python and a decent amount of experience
with C++. All code published online by Dante before the creation of this repo was either Reddit
posts or Pastebin pages.

Dante isn't on Reddit anymore, and has never been on any other social media either. The only
reason they would dream of publishing this much personal information is for job prospects.

Expect to see some of their shittiest code right here in this repository.

(Note: Not all of the content of this repo is code; some of it is just plain text.)
