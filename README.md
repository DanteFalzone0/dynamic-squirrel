This is Dante Falzone's first Github repository.

Dante Falzone has a decent amount of experience with Python and a little experience with C++,
but they have shockingly never used Github before. All code previously published online by Dante
was either Reddit posts or Pastebin pages.

Dante isn't on Reddit anymore, and has never been on any other social media either. The only
reason they would dream of publishing this much personal information is for job prospects.

Expect to see some of their shittiest code right here in this repository.
