int lost() {
    I'm so bored.
    Classes, clubs, whatever-
    I can't stand it.
    It's so pointless.
    It's boring and I hate it.

    Inside my head
    my thoughts cry out
    but my feelings drown them out;
    I'm not scared of my feelings, but they're holding all my focus;
    With no exit condition from this infinite loop;
    Stuck in an unending cycle
    of fear, and depression, and boredom.

    I don't want to live a life
    where I have to do all this
    pointless busywork;
    where day to day life
    is a complex swirl of emotions,
    a roller coaster ride towards oblivion;
    I'd rather not.

    return me_to(myself);

float helloworld() {
    Back to my usual haunt
    Wasting time in mindless staring
    at text more poisonous than strangers glaring;
    We've all been there;
    maybe as recently as a few minutes ago.
    Even when we're not, it wastes our mental space,
    wastes our sanity;
    I figured: I should learn how to use this,
    and not let it continue to use me.

    A quick Google, some hasty keypresses, and there on my screen {
        print("Hello, world!")
    }
    I hit "run", and it runs

    my mind runs with it
    and I go to learn more;
    a torrential downpour right into my brain
    from a huge resevoir I never bothered to open
    quenching a long-standing thirst;
    blood pumps through my veins, through my brain
    as I excitedly type out line after line
    of beautiful glowing monospaced poetry
    twisted loops of logic that list out from zero
    in a language of clear unambiguity
    in stark contrast to the conflicts in my mind
    which, for once, are silenced.

    return to_write_just_one_more_line();

char command() {
    I'm finally free from this world I've been trapped in
    where nothing I say seems to matter and I have no power;
    Into a world where there's just me, the code, and the computer;
    Where I can make things exactly how I want
    How I think they should be.

    I can't change the system by myself
        but I can delete Windows and install Linux.

    I can't rewrite our unjust laws and change the structure of our society
        but I can rewrite buggy programs and install fresh updates.

    Completely overturning the old system
    and installing a new one;
    all the while retaining
    the knowledge of how to command it
    and thereby the power to do so;
    free to roam and create in a world
    that I can destroy at any moment in just one line of script:
    "sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root"
    and build back up anew.

    return to_make_something_new();

int main() {
    The computer's lid shuts
    and I'm abruptly born back into the world;
    where my desires are secondary at best
    and my feelings run wild, unchecked
    a million thoughts, a million tasks
    an uncertain future, a heartless world
    one I never wanted to be in,
    now less than ever;

    In a computer I'm a wizard,
    but in reality I'm a muggle.
    People make up messy, complicated rules;
    rules that are unjust and in *serious* need of update;
    and then follow them with unpredictable consistency.
    It's maddeningly frustrating;
    I don't want to be here
    any more than before
    I want to retreat into my computer
    my respite from this disheartening world
    and write just a few more lines
    of shining bright-green code.

    return 0;
