** My understanding of the Unix filesystem as of 19 December 2019 **

? = uncertainty; . = certainty

/bin - compiled Unix utilities go here.
/boot - the bootloader lives here.
/cdrom - this is where the contents of my optical disk reader are mounted, if I have one.
/dev - lots of physical devices and other special files live here.
/etc - configuration files?
/home - I live here.
/initrd.img - the binary for the kernel lives here?
/initrd.img.old - an older version of initrd.img?
/lib - libraries go here?
/lib32 - 32-bit libraries go here?
/lib64 - 64-bit libraries go here?
/lost+found - if the system crashes, files and directories that would otherwise be lost go here?
/media - flash drives and other removable storage is mounted here.
/mnt - anything may be mounted here by root.
/opt - not sure?
/proc - process files live here.
/root - the root user's home directory.
/run - not sure?
/sbin - some compiled programs live here?
/snap - not sure?
/srv - not sure?
/swapfile - this is where surplus bits get stored if more virtual memory is needed than actual ram available.
/sys - not sure?
/tmp - files that may be deleted without warning go here.
/usr - most programs and libraries that I didn't write get stored in subdirectories here.
/var - not sure? I think that email went here on older systems?
/vmlinuz - kernel image lives here?
/vmlinuz.old - older version of vmlinuz?
